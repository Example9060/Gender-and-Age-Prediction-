# Gender-and-Age-Prediction-
This project aims to build a robust deep learning model for predicting age and gender from facial images. It utilizes the powerful VGG16 architecture for feature extraction, combined with custom layers for regression (age prediction) and classification (gender prediction). The project includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, and evaluation with metrics designed to measure the model's performance effectively.

Features
The main features of this project include:

Deep Learning Architecture:

Pretrained VGG16 is used as the backbone for feature extraction, with its weights initialized from ImageNet.
Custom fully connected layers are added to predict both age and gender.
Data Augmentation:

To increase dataset diversity and robustness, augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, brightness adjustment, and contrast adjustment are applied during preprocessing.
Metrics and Evaluation:

The project evaluates age prediction using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to quantify the average deviation between predicted and actual ages.
Gender classification is evaluated using accuracy to determine the percentage of correctly classified images.
Streamlit Integration:

A user-friendly web interface allows interactive testing of the model by uploading images and receiving predictions in real-time.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of facial images labeled with corresponding age and gender attributes. Each image is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the VGG16 input requirements. The preprocessing steps include:

Resizing all images to 224x224 pixels.
Normalizing pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
Augmenting images with variations like flipping, brightness adjustment, and contrast adjustment to simulate real-world conditions.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or newer
TensorFlow 2.10 or higher
Streamlit (optional, for web-based deployment)
Steps to Install
Clone the repository:

bash
Копировать код
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-gender-prediction.git
cd age-gender-prediction
Install required dependencies:

bash
Копировать код
pip install -r requirements.txt
Verify GPU availability (optional but recommended):

bash
Копировать код
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
Model Architecture
The model architecture leverages VGG16 as the feature extractor. The architecture for age prediction is structured as follows:

Input Layer:
Accepts images of shape (224, 224, 3).
Base Model:
VGG16 with include_top=False to use it as a feature extractor.
Custom Layers:
A dropout layer for regularization.
Fully connected dense layers for embedding and final regression output.
Example Code:
python
Копировать код
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, InputLayer
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

vgg_16 = VGG16(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), include_top=False, weights="imagenet")
vgg_16.trainable = False  # Freezing pretrained weights

age_net = Sequential([
    InputLayer((224, 224, 3)),
    vgg_16,
    Dropout(0.4),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation="relu"),
    Dense(1)  # Final regression output for age
])

age_net.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mae',  # Mean Absolute Error
    metrics=['mae', 'accuracy']
)
Training the Model
The model is trained using TensorFlow's model.fit() API. It uses EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting and ModelCheckpoint to save the best-performing model during training.

Training Example:
python
Копировать код
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint

callbacks = [
    EarlyStopping(patience=5, monitor="val_loss", restore_best_weights=True),
    ModelCheckpoint("Age-VGG16.keras", save_best_only=True)
]

history = age_net.fit(
    train_age_ds,
    validation_data=valid_age_ds,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=32,
    callbacks=callbacks
)
Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training data. Examples of augmentation include:

Horizontal Flip: Simulates mirrored faces.
Brightness Adjustment: Alters image brightness.
Contrast Adjustment: Enhances or reduces contrast.
Example of applying augmentation:

python
Копировать код
import tensorflow as tf

def augment_image(image):
    image = tf.image.flip_left_right(image)  # Horizontal Flip
    image = tf.image.adjust_brightness(image, delta=0.1)  # Brightness Adjustment
    image = tf.image.adjust_contrast(image, contrast_factor=0.8)  # Contrast Adjustment
    return image
Evaluation and Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
Measures the average deviation between predicted and true ages.
Lower MAE indicates better performance.
Accuracy:
Evaluates how often gender predictions are correct.
Example Evaluation:
python
Копировать код
results = age_net.evaluate(test_ds)
print(f"Test Loss: {results[0]}, Test MAE: {results[1]}")
Streamlit Deployment
A simple Streamlit app is included for interactive testing of the model. It allows users to upload images and get predictions for age and gender in real time.

How to Run the App:
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Копировать код
streamlit run app.py
Open the provided link (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
Results
Age Prediction:
Achieved an average MAE of ~3 years.
Gender Prediction:
Achieved an accuracy of ~90% on the validation dataset.
Future Improvements
Enhance Dataset: Include more diverse faces for better generalization.
Advanced Augmentation: Introduce additional techniques like rotation, zoom, and color jitter.
Metric Optimization: Experiment with alternative metrics like MAPE or R² for better performance assessment.
Real-Time Deployment: Integrate the model into production-ready applications.
